# web-design-challenge

well here it is. a website. i'm not sure what's going on, but when i run it on my computer it works just fine. when i copy and paste the code from here into a new sublime text doc, well son of a gun it doesn't look like it works? i don't know, it looks great on my end so i'll submit it and cross the ol' fingers.
